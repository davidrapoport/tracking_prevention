# Cookie Monster
A Chrome extension meant to increase your privacy online.
When enabled, it deletes cookies that you have not visited in the past N days (N is configurable).
For example, has anyone ever visited googleads.doubleclick.net? So why should they have a cookie on your 
computer?!?!? The extension's usefulness is diminshed if you're using an ad blocker (they block most of the scripts that drop these tracking cookies), but it's still useful for cleaning out old cruft.
